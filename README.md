# PHP Feedback Application

## Description

This is a basic feedback application, which is part of a project to add a new language to my toolkit - PHP. I utilized the following tools and skills throughout this project: PHP, XAMMP (Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl), and Figma. I enjoyed experimenting with masks and components to make my logo in Figma.
